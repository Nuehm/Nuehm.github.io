Dear Mates,

in order to open the slide deck 'index.html' properly, 'SlidifyTriangle' must 
be downloaded as a zip-folder. 

If you use a Windows system, the path name might be too long; in order to 
prevent issues please shorten the name of the zip-folder. Copying the zip-folder 
to the desktop might work as well.

Then 'index.html' can be looked at in a web-browser.

Thanks for your efford,
best regards,
Hendrik
